## Image Classification - CIFAR10 dataset

In this project, we try to predict the class of images in CIFAR10 dataset. This project was done as a part of Udacity Neural Networks Foundations Nanodegree program.

The Jupyter notebook with standard cnn model can be found [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Cifar10/blob/master/cifar10_cnn.ipynb). Jupyter Notebook with image augmentation included is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Cifar10/blob/master/cifar10_cnn_aug.ipynb).

The final Jupyter notebook file with vgg16 model for transfer learning is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Cifar10/blob/master/cifar10_cnn_vgg16.ipynb) and vgg19 model for transfer learning is 
[here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Cifar10/blob/master/cifar10_cnn_vgg19.ipynb).
